"#Kickstart-DApp" 

This decentralised application on Ethereum blockchain recreates the KickStarter campaign platform as a web3 application. This is aimed to solve the issue of funds misuse in the existing KickStarter platform. 
The solution provides the campaign contributors with the power to vote and decide how the funds would be used. The campaign creator would raise funds and create requests to utilise these funds for payments for certain tasks, and the contributors would decide on the validity of the requests. The funds would be transferred only once the majority votes for approving the request. This way the contributors can keep a check on the progress of the project, as well as ensure that all transactions and data is visible and handled transparently with easy verification On-chain. 

The project was created by using Solidity for the backend smart contract code with Truffle Framework for connectivity and ReactJs and NextJs for the front end. 

Future improvements would be along the lines of the features to provide more description for each campaign as well as storing the data of the campaigns and requests on a decentralised storage system like IPFS to reduce the cost of transactions for the users of this application.

Constructive feedback or suggestions for improvements is always welcome!
